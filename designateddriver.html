                <h2>
                    Designated <br>Driver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designated Driver is a made-up mocktail brand for my Package Design class. 
                    I was only given the specific dimensions of the packaging and a can. I 
                    wanted to create a mocktail brand that doesn't hide the fact that it is 
                    not an alcoholic beverage and gives the user a sense of pride. This is 
                    for those who aren't of age to drink yet, trying to cut back, or are 
                    literally the designated driver for the group and they don't have to 
                    feel bad about not partaking in the fun. I started with the name because 
                    whenever someone says they are not drinking they are almost always the 
                    designated driver now. So no pun intended I was able to use that as a 
                    vehicle for the entire brand. From the logo that could be on the front 
                    of an actual car to even including the bumper stickers that cover the box. 
                    I created the vehicle for someone not drinking and wanting to brag about 
                    it, and inside is their non-alcoholic beverage.

                           <p> After I created the brand name I knew I wanted the packaging to have motifs of a car. 
                               I was still unsure of how far I wanted to take the motif. I thought of a box covered 
                               in bumper stickers to the typical car air fresheners to the box as a car. </p>
                       </li>
                       <li id="process2/2">
                           <img src="img/ddprocess2.png" alt="">
                           <p>I finally landed on the box as the car with the can as the interior of that car. 
                               Then came the challenge of making the design feel unique and purposeful to the brand. </p>
                       </li>
                       <li id="process2/3">
                           <img src="img/ddprocess3.png" alt="">
                           <p> With the earlier box designs, I struggled to find ways to use the space meaningfully. 
                               This led me back to the stickers which allowed me to have a lot of fun and add some 
                               cheekiness to the brand. </p>
                       </li>
                       <li id="process2/4">
                           <img src="img/ddprocess4.png" alt="">
                           <p> For the can itself, I went back to trying to depict the interior of a car. Finding what 
                               instantly read as a car interior was the main goal. Versus my earlier editions of a car 
                               air freshener, I went with the steering wheel because it read better while adding to the 
                               fact that this is a drink you can drive with. </p>
                       </li>
