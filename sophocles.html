                    Panda = Bamboo is an exhibition about the 
                    importance of pandas to bamboo forests and 
                    vice versa. This was a project for my 
                    Exhibition Design class where I was given 
                    a space and had to curate an exhibition 
                    within the designated area. The challenge 
                    was to find the balance of finding meaningful 
                    use for the entire area without it feeling 
                    like this exhibition could have happened 
                    anywhere else. I decided to showcase the 
                    effects of cutting bamboo forests down and 
                    how that cycle is leading to the extinction 
                    of pandas and the decline of bamboo. It felt 
                    right to recreate the environment but have 
                    bamboo poles create walls that guide the audience 
                    through the exhibition. They proved useful for 
                    podiums, as well as, contrasting the taller 
                    sticks. As for the look, I wanted to reflect the 
                    starkness of the panda but use the beautiful 
                    greens to bring some life to the exhibition. 
                    The start of the exhibition provides that, while 
                    the ending lack of bamboo trees reflects that 
                    huge loss of life.
