        <p>
            Loc-Up is an instant dreadlock starter kit. This kit is for someone looking to start their dreadlocks journey and have the tools necessary to maintain the hair until it is fully locked up. This project was for my Package Design final and we were only given the requirement of a minimum of three items. we were challenged with making a unique packaging design and experience for our intended customer. Part of that experience is the intended use of the container after it is opened. I wanted something that could be reused and easily stored so I opted for a vertical oblique cylinder that can be placed on countertops or in cabinets. Part of that functionality is the split door where you can grab just the maintenance products. Splitting up the products in this way guides the customer and makes the complicated world of dreadlocks a little simpler.
