            <p> After I created the brand name I knew I wanted the packaging to have motifs of a car. 
                I was still unsure of how far I wanted to take the motif. I thought of a box covered 
                in bumper stickers to the typical car air fresheners to the box as a car. </p>
        </li>
        <li id="process2/2">
            <img src="img/ddprocess2.png" alt="">
            <p>I finally landed on the box as the car with the can as the interior of that car. 
                Then came the challenge of making the design feel unique and purposeful to the brand. </p>
        </li>
        <li id="process2/3">
            <img src="img/ddprocess3.png" alt="">
            <p> With the earlier box designs, I struggled to find ways to use the space meaningfully. 
                This led me back to the stickers which allowed me to have a lot of fun and add some 
                cheekiness to the brand. </p>
        </li>
        <li id="process2/4">
            <img src="img/ddprocess4.png" alt="">
            <p> For the can itself, I went back to trying to depict the interior of a car. Finding what 
                instantly read as a car interior was the main goal. Versus my earlier editions of a car 
                air freshener, I went with the steering wheel because it read better while adding to the 
                fact that this is a drink you can drive with. </p>
