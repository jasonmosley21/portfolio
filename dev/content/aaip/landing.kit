            An American <br> In Paris
        </h2>
        <p>
            This poster was made for a hypocritical 
            symphony show of the song An American in 
            Paris by George Gershwin. The song was 
            based on Gershwin's time visiting Paris 
            during the Annees Folles, the Roaring 
            20â€™s as we call it in the States. I wanted 
            to capture the fantastical nature of 
            that time as well as what Paris would 
            be like to an American.
