        <p>
            4DX is a curated publication that was 
            made for my Publication Design class. 
            We had almost complete creative freedom 
            and I decided to make a magazine around 
            film cinematography. I wanted for the 
            spread to feel like watching the movie 
            so I had to try and translate 
            3-dimensional effects into a 2-D format. 
            I used frames from certain scenes to 
            mimic the actual movement and overlayed 
            images on top of each other. The 
            typography accents the images by mocking 
            this motion. This gives the publication 
            a distinct feel as a magazine that lets 
            the cinematography speak for itself but 
            doesn't just take from the film.
