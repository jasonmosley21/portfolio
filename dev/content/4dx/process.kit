            <p> I started with the article instead of the overall branding to give me 
                a focus and a place to draw inspiration from. Sketches of scenes from 
                the film I was able to find scenes that stuck out to me from a 
                cinematography point of view. This would lead me to notice the use of 
                motion in the film and from there I focus of mimicking the motion.</p>

            <p>Another idea was to use elements from the film as graphics in the article. 
                However this never felt like it had a purpose. Instead I replaced those 
                graphics with text. Allow me to completely showcase the film through the text. </p>

            <p> When it came to the masthead I was trying again to simulate that motion. 
                However this was starting to become a motion publication instead of a 
                cinematography publication. So i opted for a masthead that was able 
                compatable with all aspects of cinema.</p>
