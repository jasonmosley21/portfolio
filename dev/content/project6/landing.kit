        <p>
            Sophocles is an ancient playwright from Greece that wrote mainly tragedies. Some of his most famous duels with human flaws and how they eventually lead to their downfall. I used red brush marks as an indication of death but also using different marks to hint at killers and wrong doers. The halftone texture allows for images to overlap and connect the characters in specific ways and showcase a color based on the themes of each story.
