            Panda = Bamboo is an exhibition about the 
            importance of pandas to bamboo forests and 
            vice versa. This was a project for my 
            Exhibition Design class where I was given 
            a space and had to curate an exhibition 
            within the designated area. The challenge 
            was to find the balance of finding meaningful 
            use for the entire area without it feeling 
            like this exhibition could have happened 
            anywhere else. I decided to showcase the 
            effects of cutting bamboo forests down and 
            how that cycle is leading to the extinction 
            of pandas and the decline of bamboo. It felt 
            right to recreate the environment but have 
            bamboo poles create walls that guide the audience 
            through the exhibition. They proved useful for 
            podiums, as well as, contrasting the taller 
            sticks. As for the look, I wanted to reflect the 
            starkness of the panda but use the beautiful 
            greens to bring some life to the exhibition. 
            The start of the exhibition provides that, while 
            the ending lack of bamboo trees reflects that 
            huge loss of life.
