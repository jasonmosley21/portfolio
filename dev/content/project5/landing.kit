            From The Depths
        </h2>
        <p>
            From the Depths is my interpretation of Rainer Maria Rilke’s Letters to a Young Poet. Letters to a Young Poet deals with Rilke’s philosophy on art, and I gravitated to the ideas of evolution and improvement. I used the sketches of a character I've created to convey the progress and change I have made as an artist myself. With my own art being at the center, I wanted to embrace my favorite mediums, graphite and charcoal, by blowing out the scans of my sketches and enhancing the roughness of the graphic marks.
