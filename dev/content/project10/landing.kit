            The Spiral Bookcase is a book store in Philadelphia. 
            They are catered towards readers of fantasy and fiction 
            and have a very basic web commerce site. For my web design 
            class we were tasked with making a user friendly but visually 
            engaging redesign. Me and my team knew that because it is a 
            commerce site it needs to be easy to understand, however for 
            our desktop response we created unique grid layouts that keep 
            the user interested as they continue to scroll down the page. 
            We never kept the design stale while also not disorienting 
            the user.
