        <p>
            The Wagner Free Institute of Science is a national history museum that was founded on the basis of free educational programs. It has continued its mission as well has become useful as a library and research center with its wide array of specimens. The Wagner has remained unchanged in both its mission as well as its brand. Therefore for my branding class I was tasked with developing a new brand that brought the museum into the modern day. I still wanted to keep its Victorian mystic so for the logo I referenced wax seals but kept it clean and simple. From there I focus the brand on using the logo in interesting ways to make the brand fun and exciting for children to get them to come take a course at the institute.
