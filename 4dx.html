                    <p>
                        4DX is a curated publication that was 
                        made for my Publication Design class. 
                        We had almost complete creative freedom 
                        and I decided to make a magazine around 
                        film cinematography. I wanted for the 
                        spread to feel like watching the movie 
                        so I had to try and translate 
                        3-dimensional effects into a 2-D format. 
                        I used frames from certain scenes to 
                        mimic the actual movement and overlayed 
                        images on top of each other. The 
                        typography accents the images by mocking 
                        this motion. This gives the publication 
                        a distinct feel as a magazine that lets 
                        the cinematography speak for itself but 
                        doesn't just take from the film.

                                <p> I started with the article instead of the overall branding to give me 
                                    a focus and a place to draw inspiration from. Sketches of scenes from 
                                    the film I was able to find scenes that stuck out to me from a 
                                    cinematography point of view. This would lead me to notice the use of 
                                    motion in the film and from there I focus of mimicking the motion.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li id="process1/2">
                                <img src="img/Asset2-8.png" alt="">
                                <p>Another idea was to use elements from the film as graphics in the article. 
                                    However this never felt like it had a purpose. Instead I replaced those 
                                    graphics with text. Allow me to completely showcase the film through the text. </p>

                            <li id="process1/3">
                                <img src="img/Asset1-8.png" alt="">
                                <p> When it came to the masthead I was trying again to simulate that motion. 
                                    However this was starting to become a motion publication instead of a 
                                    cinematography publication. So i opted for a masthead that was able 
                                    compatable with all aspects of cinema.</p>
